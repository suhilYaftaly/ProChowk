# Web README

## Overview

This web application is built using [React 18](https://reactjs.org/) and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). It utilizes [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) for routing, [Material UI](https://mui.com/) for the UI kit, [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/) for making API calls and caching API data, [React-Toastify](https://fkhadra.github.io/react-toastify/introduction) for toasts, and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) for some state management. The project is heavily based on TypeScript.

## Prerequisites

- Install the latest version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository**: if you havn't done so already.

   ```sh

   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**:
